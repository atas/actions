# Ata's GitHub Actions

Reusable GitHub Actions for CI/CD workflows.

## [bump-release-calver](./bump-release-calver)

Bumps the patch version of the latest release using calendar versioning (e.g., `2024.01.1` → `2024.01.2`).

## [changed-dirs](./changed-dirs)

Detects which subdirectories under a path have changed files. Uses the GitHub API — works with shallow checkouts.

## [ssh-exec](./ssh-exec)

Sets up SSH and runs a deployment script on a remote server.

## [ssg-html-builder](./ssg-html-builder)

Builds static HTML files from PHP sources using [atas/ssg](https://github.com/atas/ssg).
